1.List the components of hadoop2.X and explain each component in detail.
Hadoop 2.x is composed of 3 components.They are:

(1)HDFS
(2)MAPREDUCE
(3)YARN

HDFS 
*HDFS stands for Hadoop Distributed File System.
*HDFS is developed using java.
*Hadoop uses HDFS for storage purpose.
*It  deals with a storage of large amounts of data in a reliable manner .
*It helps to stream the data to user applications with high bandwidth.
*HDFS runs on commodity hardware.
*HDFS stores files across the collection of servers in a cluster.
*HDFS detects and compensates for hardware issues.
*Shell commands is supported by Hadoop to interact with HDFS
Advantages:
It  is  
 *fault-tolerant
 *scalable
 *distributed storage system.
 *HDFS is composed of two components.They are:
              -Namenode
              -Datanode
 *Namenode:
              - The namenode is used to store metadata.
              -It acts as the master node.
              -It stores the information about the data nodes like
               how many blocks are stored in the nodes,which node 
               holds the data,node locations etc.
 *Secondary namenode:
              -secondary namenodes performs house-keeping activities 
               for name node like periodic merging and it is used for edits. 

 *Datanode:
              -The data nodes are used to store the actual data.
              -It acts as slave nodes.
              -The default size of the block is 64MB.
              -It stores the data in terms of blocks
              -The data node acts as the heart beat of the name node 
               as it periodically sends signals to the name node
               to check whether it is active.


MAPREDUCE

   *Map reduce is also known as distributed data processing or batch processing model 
   *It distributes the data across several machines.      
   *The software framework which is used to process large amounts of data parallelly on large clusters is known
    as mapreduce.  

 - Map reduce is composed of two components .They are:
                -Job tracker.
                -Task tracker. 
*Job Tracker:
               -The main role of job tracker is to assign the map reduce task to the task tracker.
               -It is also used to re-assign some task to the other task tracker
                when the previous task trackers fails or when it gets shut down.
               -It is used to control the overall execution of map reduce.
               -Job tracker also maintains the status of the task tracker.

*Task Tracker:
               -The task tracker sends the status back to the job tracker              
               -The role of the task tracker is to execute the task assigned to it by the job tracker.
               -It periodically communicates with the task tracker.
               -It runs individual map-reduce tasks on the data nodes.

YARN

 *YARN stands for  Yet Another Resource Negotiator .
 *A sofware that decouples Mapreduce's resource management and scheduling capabilities from the data , thus
   enabling hadoop for supporting more processing approaches and a wide range of application is known as YARN.
 *It is a cluster management technology of hadoop2.
 *YARN includes  a central resource manager that reconciles way of applications  that uses hadoop system resources
  with the node manager agents which monitor processing operations of the individual cluster nodes.
 *YARN is one of the key features of second version of hadoop.
 *YARN is designed to split up the functionalities of resource management and monitoring into separate daemons.
 *It was found by Apache Software Foundation 
 *YARN is an open source distributed processing framework.
 *YARN extends the power pf hadoop and new technologies found within the data center.
Advantages
*YARN is cost effective,
*YARN has linear-scale storage and processing
